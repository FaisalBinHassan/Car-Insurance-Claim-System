# Car Insurance Claim System

It may be hard to cover the costs for car repairs without insurance in case of accidents. Similarly in case of major damage, car insurance shields the car owner from a lawsuit. The car insurance protects the owner and assists them with claims in the event of an accident. You are required to develop a software system for the insurance company to register all cars, their owners, and the insurance coverage details. This information will be used while processing the claims. 

The system you are required to develop is called Car Insurance Claim System and is expected to assist the insurance company to smoothly process the claims. At the beginning, the system will register all the available cars, owners, and insurance coverage details from inputCICSData.txt. Information read from inputCICSData.txt are written with all the details into the insurance information file, called CICSDatabase.txt. After adding the initial data, the system will be ready to process claims for any registered car. For each claim, the carâ€™s number plate, owner's national ID, insurance coverage code, location, date, insurance type and disability is read from the input file inputClaims.txt. 

After processing each claim, the details are written to the output file ClaimInvoices.txt. Claims include all the details and insurance coverage amount and will be calculated as per insurance coverage policy. As per company policy, additional amount will be added automatically in case of premium insurance policy, special offer, and senior citizen.
